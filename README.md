# Exploring Musical Preference with Spotify User Streaming Data

The goal of this project is to gain insight into the musical attributes of Spotify user streaming data. This analysis is on music alone, excluding podcasts, talk shows, et cetera.

The data was downloaded from my personal [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) and combined with "audio feature" data extracted via the Spotify API. [Audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features) are metrics that characterize a tracks danceability, energy, valence, and more.  This article from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-spotify-streaming-history-with-python-d5a208bbcbd3) describes the method.

### Summary of Results

Streaming time over months appears to be somewhat cyclical, with periods of high and low streaming. The top tracks consist of Hip Hop/Rap and EDM, but also include Lo-fi of different flavors.
